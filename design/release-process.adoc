# Release Process

Releasing an image into the public cloud is a process which involves
a number of steps we in the public cloud team currently run manually
using a collection of tools and howtos.

# Name it...

In an effort to find a name that matches our commitment to beer
I just picked up `mash` as a first shot just to have something to
get started with :-) An explanation on the wonderful term can be
found here:

Actually releasing an image to the public cloud feels a little
bit like; mix it and serve it ;)

# Steps Of An Image Release Process

The following information forms the basic steps to release a system
image in the public cloud and provides the basic information to design the
user interface and services

1. Connect to an image provider +
   In our case all images are build in the buildservice. Thus a
   connection to the build service in order to fetch the image from
   is needed.

2. Upload system image to Cloud Service Provider +
   For upload of the image the cloud service framework provides
   tools or an sdk which we will make use of.

3. Register/Create a pubcloud image from the uploaded system image +
   For image registration an api call to the cloud service framework
   is required. We will make use of an sdk to send the request.
   The identification of the created image is handled differently
   in the public clouds, some use an id others the name.

4. Test pubcloud image +
   For testing the image an instance is started and several tests
   from the public cloud Team will be called.

5. Replicate pubcloud image to regions +
   Once the pubcloud image has been created and tested in one region it needs
   to be _copied_ in order to become available in other regions. We will
   make use of an sdk to send the request which does that.

6. Publish pubcloud image +
   In order to mark an image as public different workflows apply
   depending on the cloud service provider. One have an api others
   requires to register an image in a specific bucket.

   NOTE:
   the publish implementation does not cover any registration
   into the cloud service provider marketplace as this is a process
   which can not be fully automated

7. Deprecate old pubcloud image(s) +
   As soon as a new pubcloud image has been published there is an old
   one which will become obsolete after a specific amount of time.
   SUSE internally we implemented a deprecation policy. All steps needed
   to mark an old pubcloud image as such needs to be done directly after
   publishing a new one.

   NOTE:
   only Google provides an API for image deprecation, in order to keep
   track and react when the image becomes obsolete we use the trello
   system which also provides an API to create cards and allows to
   react on a due date.

8. Update pubcloud info Server data +
   As soon as a new pubcloud image has been published the information
   about that image should be added to the pint database.
