# Service Design

The implementation of the public cloud image release process
is based on a collection of services which itself completes
an individual task of the process. So far the following services
are needed:

* OBS service +
  Job: Watch an obs project building an image to meet certain
  conditions. On connect respond with status for all jobs.
** The service needs a proper osc config on the host it runs

* Upload Service +
  Job: Upload and register given image to given cloud service
  provider. On connect respond with image ID for all jobs
** The service needs proper config and credentials for all
   supported cloud providers on the host it runs

* Testing Service +
  Job: Run an instance of a given image and perform tests
  On connect respond with the test status for all jobs
** The service needs a proper ipa config and credentials
   for all supported cloud providers needed to run and access
   instances

* Publish Service +
  Job: Replicate and Publish a given image. On connect respond
  with the status of replication and publish availability for
  all jobs
** The service needs proper config and credentials for all
   supported cloud providers on the host it runs

* Deprecation Service +
  Job: Deprecate given image on the public cloud side(if supported)
  and in the pint database. On connect respond with the
  status of the deprecation
** The service needs proper config and credentials for all
   supported cloud providers and access to the pint database
   on the host it runs

* Logging Service +
  Job: Connect to all given service ports in a timeboxed fasion
  and fill a logfile for each job.

* Orchestration Service +
  Job: Provide scheduling for jobs and manage them in the
  correct processing order to drive the release.
  All jobs for a release process are covered under the same
  job id

* Authentication Service +
  Job: Handle user authentication and permissions management
  to allow access to the CSP account credentials stored in a
  database

On top of all services an application implements the workflow
from image to release. The application will talk to the Orchestrator
and the Authentication Services.

Each of the services are designed to function as follows:
